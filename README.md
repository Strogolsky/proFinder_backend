## 🚀 Service Overview

**ProFinder** is a comprehensive service marketplace platform designed to bridge the gap between clients seeking professional services and skilled specialists. 

The platform enables clients to post job listings for various tasks and connect with qualified professionals. Specialists can showcase their expertise, browse available opportunities, and apply for projects that match their skills.

This backend service powers the core functionality including user management, job postings, search capabilities, real-time communication, and transaction processing.

## 📚 Documentation

Full design and architecture documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/) (start at
[`docs/Home.md`](docs/Home.md)), synced both ways with the
[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Strogolsky/proFinder_backend/wiki).

Those documents describe the **target architecture** — a set of microservices on a
RabbitMQ event bus. This repository is currently a single Quarkus module that
implements a subset of it; where the two disagree, the docs are the intended
design. See [`.github/wiki-sync.md`](.github/wiki-sync.md) for how the sync works.
