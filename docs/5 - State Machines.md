# ProFinder — State Machines

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-09-10
**Status:** Stable
**Purpose:** Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` state machines for every entity that has one — Order, Professional Profile, Account, Report, Ban Appeal, Review.

Most logic here was already decided prose in [4 - Business logic.md](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md) and [2 - Requirements.md](2%20-%20Requirements.md); two gaps found while diagramming (professional profile category/city floor, `PENDING_VERIFICATION` ban/suspend) were decided on 2026-09-04 and folded back into file 4. Referenced from [Documentation Roadmap.md](Documentation%20Roadmap.md) (Block C, "State" row).

---

## 1. Order
---

Full lifecycle described in [4 - Business logic.md § Order Lifecycle](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#order-lifecycle) and [§ State Transitions](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#state-transitions).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DRAFT: customer creates order

    DRAFT --> ACTIVE: publish() (can only happen once)
    DRAFT --> [*]: delete() hard delete, no recovery

    ACTIVE --> CLOSED: closeOrder() customer, manual
    ACTIVE --> CLOSED: system auto-close customer banned / suspended / deleted

    CLOSED --> [*]: final — no reopening, ever
```

**Notes:**
- No soft-delete, no DELETED status — see [Decisions Made (Orders)](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#decisions-made-orders).
- Expiration (`expires_at`) does **not** change status — an expired order stays `ACTIVE` but drops out of professional search results until extended or closed.


## 2. Professional Profile
---

Described in [4 - Business logic.md § Professional Profile](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#professional-profile) and [FR-Profile-P5](2%20-%20Requirements.md).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> INCOMPLETE: professional registers

    INCOMPLETE --> ACTIVE: name set + ≥1 category + ≥1 city
```

**Decided (2026-09-04):** `ACTIVE` is sticky — there is no reverse transition. A professional can never drop below 1 category or 1 city: the API only allows **replacing** the last remaining category/city (swap), not clearing it to zero. So a profile that reached `ACTIVE` cannot fall back to `INCOMPLETE` through editing. See [4 - Business logic.md § Professional Profile](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#professional-profile).


## 3. Account Status
---

Consolidated from three separate sections that each define one piece of this machine — [Authentication § Email Registration](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#email-registration) (`PENDING_VERIFICATION`), [Report System § Decision & Action](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#decision--action) (`SUSPENDED` / `BANNED`), and [Account Deletion](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#account-deletion) (`DELETED`). This diagram is the first place all of it is drawn as one machine.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING_VERIFICATION: registration (email or Google)

    PENDING_VERIFICATION --> ACTIVE: email verified

    ACTIVE --> SUSPENDED: moderator suspends (1–365 days)
    SUSPENDED --> ACTIVE: suspension expires\n(auto-return)

    ACTIVE --> BANNED: moderator bans (permanent by default)
    BANNED --> ACTIVE: ban appeal upheld (different moderator)
    BANNED --> BANNED: ban appeal rejected (final, no further recourse)

    ACTIVE --> DELETED: user soft-deletes own account
    PENDING_VERIFICATION --> DELETED: user soft-deletes own account
    DELETED --> ACTIVE: user logs in within 30-day grace period
    DELETED --> [*]: grace period expires PII permanently purged
```

**Notes / decisions:**
- A user **cannot** self-delete while `SUSPENDED` or `BANNED`, or with an open report against them — so there is deliberately no `SUSPENDED → DELETED` or `BANNED → DELETED` edge (see [Account Deletion](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#account-deletion)).
- **Decided (2026-09-04):** a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` account **cannot** be suspended or banned. Moderation action requires the account to be email-verified (`ACTIVE`) first — there is deliberately no `PENDING_VERIFICATION → SUSPENDED` or `PENDING_VERIFICATION → BANNED` edge. A report against an unverified user can still be filed and reviewed; the moderator just can't act on it with suspend/ban until the account verifies.
- JWT `account_status` claim (see [FR-Auth-5](2%20-%20Requirements.md)) is presumably one of these exact values — worth confirming when the DB schema/enum is defined.


## 4. Report
---

Workflow described in [4 - Business logic.md § Report Workflow](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#report-workflow).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted: user files report

    submitted --> under_review: moderator picks it up (shared queue, no assignment)

    under_review --> resolved: decision made (dismiss / warning / suspend / ban / remove content)

    resolved --> [*]
```


## 5. Ban Appeal
---

Described in [4 - Business logic.md § Ban Appeals](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#ban-appeals). Only bans are appealable — warnings, suspensions, and dismissed reports have no appeal flow.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> filed: banned user files appeal (within 30 days of ban)

    filed --> upheld: different moderator reviews ban lifted, account restored
    filed --> rejected: different moderator reviews ban stands, final

    upheld --> [*]
    rejected --> [*]
```

**Note:** one appeal per ban — there is no appeal of the appeal (see [4 - Business logic.md § Ban Appeals](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#ban-appeals)).


## 6. Review (Moderation)
---

Described in [4 - Business logic.md § Reviews](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#reviews) and [§ Moderation & Reports](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#moderation--reports). No formal states are named in prose — this is the simplest machine in the system: reactive-only moderation, published immediately, removed only if reported.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PUBLISHED: review posted (no pre-publish moderation)

    PUBLISHED --> REMOVED: moderator removes (only if reported)

    REMOVED --> [*]
```

**Note:** same machine applies to professional replies to reviews and to portfolio photos (see [Portfolio Management](4%20-%20Business%20logic.md#portfolio-management)) — all three content types share this identical reactive-moderation shape.
